    "In this lecture, we've discussed just some of the basics of hypothesis testing in Python. I introduced you to the SciPy library, which you can use for the students t test. We've discussed some of the practical issues which arise from looking for statistical significance. There's much more to learn about hypothesis testing, for instance, there are different tests used, depending on the shape of your data and different ways to report results instead of just p-values such as confidence intervals or bayesian analyses. But this should give you a basic idea of where to start when comparing two populations for differences, which is a common task for data scientists."
